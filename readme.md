#What is this?
This is a very basic Vulkan library for displaying graphics. Vulkan is a industry-standard graphics API that has the potential to be extremely fast at rendering 3d objects on a monitor. In this project, I only was able to render a couple triangles, but behind the scenes there was tons of things that has to happen to get that far.
# Setup
```
git clone https://github.com/davidmedin/Volcano
cd Volcano
git submodule update --init --recursive
build.bat
```
You might need to move glfw3.dll into bin/debug/ btw
